# median-of-two-sorted-arrays
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.  The median is the middle value in a sorted list. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The required runtime complexity for this problem is O(log (m+n)).
